        ## Important: Read First
        - We only accept tests on major releases and not nightly builds. For example: v0.7.0. Do not test on v0.7.1 WIP, or on any forks.
        - Only test officially released Playstation 4 games. You can find a list of games here: https://www.serialstation.com/games/
        - You've made sure there are no other issues opened for this game and operating system combo.
        - Your game dump must come from a copy of the game you own.
        - Your game dump must be unmodified, and you must not enable any game patches. Dumps repackaged to FPKGs will be treated the same way.
        - Make sure your logging type is set to "sync" and not "async".
